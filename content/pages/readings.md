For each date, there is required reading from sections in the textbook and sections in the course reader. You are to read the material before the lecture.

Textbook
--------

Simmons, George F. _Calculus with Analytic Geometry_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, October 1, 1995. ISBN: 0070576424.

Readings in the textbook are listed by section numbers (e.g., § 2.1-2.4 means read sections 2.1 through 2.4.)

Course Reader
-------------

MIT students will be provided with a copy of the Course Reader: Jerison, D., and A. Mattuck. _Calculus_1\. Readings in the Course Reader are listed as "Notes". (Not available to OCW users.)
